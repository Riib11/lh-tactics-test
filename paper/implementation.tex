\section{Implementation}

Organization idea:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Overview the entire procedure:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The user writes a proof macro term in ``tactic'' quasiquotes as their proof, in EDSL1 i.e. the proof macro language
    \item The proof macro term is preprocessed into a ``proto proof term'' in EDSL2 i.e. the metadata-augmented subset of Haskell relevant for extrinsic proofs
    \item The ``proto proof term'' is embedded into Haskell, then spliced the place of the original proof macro. The file is checked.
    \item If the check passes, then the proto proof term is pruned by repeatedly pruning the proto proof term, embedding and splicing it into the place of the original proof macro, and checking if the pruned result still passes.
    \item The resulting proof term is a valid proof as determined by Liquid Haskell.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Detail the features of EDSL1 and the intended behaviors
  \item Briefly describe the details of EDSL2
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe how each feature in EDSL1 is implemented by a preprocessing transformation into EDSL2
    \item Preprocessing EDSL1 into EDSL2 is a contextual transformation, since it needs to keep track of an environment which includes various information (see Language.Core.Syntax.Environment'')
    \item How the ``auto'' term in EDSL2 includes metadata for which terms have have been pruned and which have been determined necessary.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Detail pruning procedure
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Clearly, this can be done more efficiently.
    \item Point out further possible work like checking for well-typed applications where the function has refined argument types.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The proof macro system processes an input proof macro into an output Liquid Haskell proof term into stages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user writes the input proof macro in Template Haskell quasiquotes. Then the user runs \TheTool \todo{how to talk about this executable} on the file containing the target proof macro to process. The quasiquoted proof macro is parsed into \LangA.
  \item The \LangATerm is processed into a corresponding \LangBTerm, and all metadata values are given initial defaults.
  \item The \LangBTerm is cached, embedded into Haskell, and then spliced in place of the original proof macro. 
  \item The cached \LangBTerm is repeatedly pruned, making use of the metadata to track pruning progress, where each pruning step involves removing some proof terms contained inside of the entire \LangBTerm, embedding and splicing it in place of the original proof macro, and then running Liquid Haskell to check that the prune step was valid.
\end{enumerate}
  
%  The proof macro system provides macros for each kind of component:
%  Macros I:
%  - \code{induct x}: does case analysis on x, and if x was an input variable then notes that in each match, the pattern's variables are valid to use in recursive calls at the position of the input variable (this is taken to account in the "auto" c)
%  - \code{destruct x}: does case analysis on x
%  - \code{assert b}: conditions on b and treats the False case as trivial 
%  - \code{dismiss b}: conditions on b and treats the True case as trivial
%  - \code{condition b}: conditions on b and handles both cases
%  Macros II:
%  - \code{auto}: generates all well-typed applications of terms in context (with output type Proof), using terms in context, up to a depth
%  - \code{use e}: includes the refinement of the expression e into the refinement context
%  - \code{trivial}: includes the trivial proof into the refinement context
  
 The proof of "assoc\_min" can be expressed shortly as follows:
  
 The "induct a" macro does case analsis on "a", resulting in two branches. Since both branches are to be handled, the following two macros are executed in both branches (matching the behavior of the ";" tactic combinator in Coq).
 Additionally, in the "S a'" case, the "induct a" tactic notices that "a'" was introduced by inducting on an input variable term in positon 0, so "a'" is marked as a valid argument to a recursive call to "assoc\_min" in position 0.
 The same happens for "induct b" and "induct c", yielding the same branches of the verbose Haskell term.
 Finally, every proof macro implicitly ends with "auto" unless it ends with "trivial" or "use e".
 So, in each of the 9 branches, "auto" is executed to generate all well-typed terms of type "Proof" using things in local context.
 In all but the "S a', S b', S c'" case, there are no such well-typed applications, since the only way to produce a term of type "Proof" is to use "assoc\_min", but only in that final is there a term in context that is available to use as the argument to a recursive call to "assoc\_min", for each of its argment positions (which are 0, 1, 2 since it has 3 arguments and each is inducted on).
  
  
 There are two EDSLs:
 - EDSL1 (proof macro EDSL): the EDSL that the user uses to write proof macros
 - EDSL2: the subset of Haskell that proof macros can expand into i.e. the image of EDSL1 under preprocessing, augmented with metadata used in pruning
  
 The proof macro system involves two stages:
 - preprocessing:
   - preprocess ESL1 into EDSL2
   - embed EDSL2 into Haskell code to be spliced
 - pruning:
   - pruning algorithm over EDSL2 
     - EDSL2 has pruning-relevant metadata e.g. which terms have been prune/kept from an auto site
     - in each step of the pruning algorithm, checks if current prune is valid by embedding the current pruned expression into Haskell then running Liquid Haskell
  
\subsection{Preprocessing}
  
%s EDSL1 is used by the user to write proof macros inside of quasiquotes of the form \texttt{[tactic|...|]}
%  
% %Grammar of EDSL1:
% \begin{align*}
%   \textit{decl}~ ::= &
%     \textit{name} ~ : ~ \textit{type} \\ &
%     \textit{name} ~ \overline{\textit{name}} ~ = ~ \overline{\textit{instr} ; }
%   \\
%    \textit{instr} ~ ::= &
%      \textbf{intro} ~ \textit{name} \\ | &
%      \textbf{destruct} ~ \textit{name} ~ (\textbf{as} ~ \textit{destruct-pat}) ([\overline{\textit{flag},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{induct} ~ \textit{name} ~ (\textbf{as} ~ \textit{pat}) ([\overline{\textit{induct-flag},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{auto} ~ (\overline{\textit{name},}) (\textit{nat}) \\ | &
%      \textbf{condition} ~ \textit{exp} ~ (\textbf{requires} ~ [\overline{\textit{name},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{assert} ~ \textit{exp} ~ (\textbf{requires} ~ [\overline{\textit{name},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{dismiss} ~ \textit{exp} ~ (\textbf{requires} ~ [\overline{\textit{name},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{use} ~ \textit{exp} ~ (\textbf{requires} ~ [\overline{\textit{name},}]) \\ | &
%      \textbf{trivial}
%  \end{align*}
%   
 The language EDSL1, defined above, is preprocessed into EDSL2 which is a subset of Haskell augmented with metadata. 
 The conceptual distinction between EDSL1 and EDSL2 is that preprocessing EDSL1 requires a context and producing many expressions per single EDSL1 instruction, whereas EDSL2 is strictly an embedding into Haskell and so each EDSL2 expression corresponds to exactly one Haskell expression.
  
% Grammar of EDSL2:
% \begin{align*}
%   \textit{decl}~ ::= &
%     \textit{name} ~ : ~ \textit{type} \\ &
%     \textit{name} ~ \overline{\textit{name}} ~ = ~ \textit{expr}
%   \\
%   \textit{expr}~ ::= &
%     \mathbf{\lambda} ~ \textit{name} ~ \textbf{->} ~ \textit{instr} \\ &
%     \textbf{case} ~ \textit{exp} ~ \textbf{of} ~ \overline{\textit{pat} ~ \textbf{->} ~ \textit{exp} ;} \\ & 
%     \textbf{if} ~ \textit{exp} ~ \textbf{then} ~ \textit{exp} ~ \textbf{else} ~ \textit{exp} \\ & 
%     \textbf{auto} ~ [\overline{\textit{exp} ;}] \textit{pruning-metadata} \\ & 
%     \textbf{trivial}
% \end{align*}
%  
 An EDSL1 declaration is preprocessed into an EDSL2 declaration like so:
  
 \begin{verbatim}
 preprocessDecl : EDSL1-decl -> EDSL2-decl
 preprocessDecl (name, args, type, instrs) =
   set function name to name
   set output type to type
   for each arg
     get output type as a -> b 
     store type of arg as a
     set output type to b
   preprocess instrs
  
 // stateful
 preprocess : [EDSL1-instr] -> EDSL2-expr
 preprocess [] = []
 preprocess (instr : instrs) = case instr of 
   intro x -> do
     [|a <- b|] <- get output type
     type of x := a
     output type := b
     [|\x -> $(preprocess instrs)|]
   destruct exp requires xs -> do
     if all of xs are in scope then 
       varss <- get patterns for deconstructing exp
       constrs <- constructors of the datatype of exp
       matches <- 
         for each (vars, constr) in (varss * constrs)
           args <- argument types of constr
           for each (var, arg) in in (pats * args)
             type of var := arg
           [|ps -> $(preprocess instrs)|]
       [|case exp of matches|]
     else
       preprocess instrs
   induct exp requires xs -> do
     if all of xs are in scope then 
       varss <- get patterns for deconstructing exp
       constrs <- constructors of the datatype of exp
       matches <-
         for each (vars, constr) in (varss * constrs)
           args <- argument types of constr
           for each (var, arg) in in (pats * args)
             if exp is an argument to the top-level proposition then
               add var to context of recursive-safe expression to fill the
               respective argument of a recursive call
             type of var := arg
           [|ps -> $(preprocess instrs)|]
       [|case exp of matches|]
     else
       preprocess instrs
   auto hints depth ->
     generate all neutral forms in context, up to depth
     when a recursion is generated, at least one of its arguments must be something from the context of recursive safe expressions for that argument (which is populated via induct)
   assert exp requires xs ->
     if all of xs are in scope then
       [|if exp then $(preprocess instrs) else True|]
     else
       preprocess instrs
   dismiss exp requires xs ->
     if all of xs are in scope then
       [|if exp then True else $(preprocess instrs)|]
     else
       preprocess instrs
   use exp requires xs -> 
     [|use exp &&& $(preprocess instrs)]
   condition exp requires xs ->
     [|if exp then $(preprocess instrs) else $(preprocess instrs)]
   trivial ->
     [|trivial|]
  
  
 \end{verbatim}
  
 \subsection{Pruning}
  
 \subsubsection{Linear Pruning}
  
 For each auto site (i.e. each apreprocearance of \textbf{auto} in the preprocessed EDSL2), each \textit{exp} it uses is pruned one at a time, checking to see if Liquid Haskell still passes after the pruning. If a prune succeeds the pruned \textit{exp} is discarded, otherwise the pruned \textit{exp} is returned to the original \textbf{auto} site.
