%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Liquid Haskell is a popular verifier for Haskell programs,
leveraging the power of SMT solvers to ease users' burden of proof.
%
However, this power does not come without a price:
convincing Liquid Haskell that a program is correct
often necessitates giving hints to the underlying solver, which can be
a tedious and verbose process that sometimes requires intricate
knowledge of Liquid Haskell's inner workings.

In this paper, we present {\em Liquid Proof Macros}, an extensible
metaprogramming technique and framework for simplifying the
development of Liquid Haskell proofs.
%
We describe how to leverage Template Haskell to generate Liquid
Haskell proof terms, via a tactic-inspired DSL interface for more
concise and user-friendly proofs,
%
and we demonstrate the capabilities of this framework by automating
a wide variety of proofs from an existing Liquid Haskell benchmark.
