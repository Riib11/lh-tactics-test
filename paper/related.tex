\paragraph{Meta F*}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{MetaF}
\item Closest (refinement types)
\item Same issues (SMT non-interactive)
\item Heavier-weight solution reifying VC state for users (could be really helpful)
\item More flexibility ecosystem wise.
\item Our goal was to simplify user experience within the much more rigid constraints
  of Haskell. In a free-world, the Meta-F* approach is probably better.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interactive Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Related: tactics in interactive proof assistants like Coq, Lean or Isabelle.
\item Coq has seen a ton of work in this, starting with the original
  Ltac implementation.
\item Mtac was a monadic/typed version
\item Ltac2 is a recent revision that is starting to get traction~\cite{ComputingCorrectly}
\item Coqhammer~\cite{CoqHammer, Coqhammer-sauto}
\item In Lean, just tactics?
\item In Isabelle, hammers and tactics.\leo{Which ones?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Liquid Haskell Automation}
\begin{itemize}
\item PLE (complementary) \leo{Which citation?}
\item Master thesis (not intuitive syntax, source of benchmark, never adopted)
\item Rewriting paper? \cite{REST-rewriting}
\end{itemize}
